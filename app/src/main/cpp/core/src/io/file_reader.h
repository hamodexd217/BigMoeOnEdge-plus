// A pooled, positioned file reader with optional cache-bypassing I/O (O_DIRECT on POSIX,
// FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING on Windows, F_NOCACHE on Apple).
//
// One reader owns N lane fds and N bounce buffers, so N threads can read distinct byte ranges of the
// same file concurrently without contending. Where the platform's direct mode is an I/O mode that
// rejects unaligned access (O_DIRECT, NO_BUFFERING), a direct read aligns its window to the read
// alignment, pulls it into the lane's bounce buffer, and memcpy's the requested interior out — the
// mechanics those modes require. Apple's F_NOCACHE is not such a mode — a caching hint on the
// descriptor — so a direct reader there keeps ordinary pread semantics and skips the bounce
// entirely; see pio::direct_needs_alignment(). `direct` is a property of the reader, chosen by
// whoever opens it: the expert streamer and the dense-weights loader each construct their own, so
// one can bypass the page cache while the other does not — the two decisions are independent, not
// a shared global.
//
// The O_DIRECT request is verified once at open: on storage where a direct read returns garbage
// (some FUSE-backed emulated volumes) the reader silently falls back to buffered I/O for the file,
// so a caller never has to reason about the storage — it asks for direct and gets correct bytes.
// direct() reports the effective mode after all of that, which is what telemetry must print, not
// what the caller requested.
