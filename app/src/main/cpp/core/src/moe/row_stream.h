// Row-gathered dense tables, served from flash instead of RAM.
//
// The default dense policy makes every non-expert weight resident, because that is what a weight
// that is multiplied is: read whole, every token. A table the graph only GATHERS ROWS from is not
// that. A token embedding is the extreme case — one row per decoded token out of a vocabulary of
// hundreds of thousands — and on a big model it is hundreds of MiB of residency bought for a
// kilobyte of use per token. On a phone that RAM is the whole budget: it is what the expert cache
// does not get, and what the kernel reclaims to zram when it runs out.
//
// So: reserve the table's address space, bind the tensor to it, and commit only the pages the
// graph is about to read, filled by an O_DIRECT read of exactly those bytes. The reservation
// mirrors the tensor's own byte layout, so ggml's address arithmetic (`data + i*nb1`) is
// unchanged and the gather kernel is untouched — the same trick the expert cache plays on
// `mul_mat_id`, at row granularity instead of expert granularity.
//
// WHICH tables get this is not a list in this file and not a name pattern: it is what the graph
// says (see RouterHook's capture pass). A table qualifies only when EVERY reference to it in the
// captured graph is a row gather, and the index it is gathered by is materialized before the node
// runs. Anything else — a weight that is also multiplied, tied embeddings used as the output head,
// an index computed inside the graph — is not served here and keeps the dense policy it had.
// materialize() is the belt to that braces: a graph shape we never saw still gets its bytes.
//
// The residency window is bounded (`budget_bytes`) and evicted LRU, in page-aligned SLABS rather
// than single rows: a row is ~1 KiB, a read below the device's request floor costs the same as one
// at it, and adjacent vocabulary rows recur. The budget is a ceiling, not a target — a run that
// gathers few distinct rows simply never fills it.
