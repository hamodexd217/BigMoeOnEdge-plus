// Streamed experts for a prefill graph that runs on a device.
//
// A model larger than RAM cannot give the device a resident copy of its experts, and a prefill graph
// hundreds of tokens wide needs nearly every expert of every layer anyway. So the device gets TWO
// layer-sized slots of expert weights and every MoE layer's expert tensors are bound to one of them,
// alternating. While the device computes layer k out of one slot, a pool of loader threads fills the
// other with layer k+1: read each expert's bytes from the gguf, hand them to the backend through
// ggml_backend_tensor_set on a per-expert view (which is where a repacking backend lays them out in
// its own format). One flash pass per graph, hidden behind compute when compute is the longer of the
// two.
//
// The pacing point is the layer's routing node, which the router hook already knows how to find and
// isolate: when the scheduler stops there, every op of layer k-1 has finished, so the slot k+1 goes
// into is free, and nothing of layer k that needs experts has run yet. barrier() queues the next fill
// and waits for the current one. The routing itself is not read: at this width it selects nearly
// every expert, and on the device it is not in host memory to read.
//
// The layer's other weights (attention, norms, shared experts) can ride the same two-slot scheme
// (init_dense). They are resident on the host already, so filling them is a copy, not a read; what
// they cost the device is two layers of them instead of all of them, which on unified memory is the
// difference between fitting the device's session and not. They are needed before the layer's
// routing, so they are paced one layer ahead, at the last node of the previous layer (learned from
// the capture graph, since no node name is common to every architecture).
//
// Decode never sees any of this. place(false) hands every expert tensor back to the binding it had
// (the streamer's), and the slots are not a cache: each graph refills them from layer 0.
