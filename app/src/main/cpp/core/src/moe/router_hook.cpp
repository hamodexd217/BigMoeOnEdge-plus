// The four-accumulator shape is not a micro-optimisation, it is what makes this loop vectorize at
// all: floating-point addition is not associative, so a compiler may not re-order a single-
// accumulator reduction, and the obvious `acc += p[d] * h[d]` compiles to one scalar multiply-add
// per cycle however high the optimisation level. Splitting the reduction into independent partial
// sums gives the vectorizer permission it cannot take on its own. Measured on the host: 0.77 ->
// 0.20 ms per gate pass on a 256-expert model — and this is the whole feature's per-layer tax, so
// on a 4-thread phone (where it competes with the decode for cores AND for DRAM bandwidth) it was
// the difference between a win and a rout. The partial sums change the summation order, so the

// exist for (this build targets armv8.2-a+dotprod), and the shape a compiler will vectorize
// without needing permission to reorder a float reduction. Both effects point the same way on a
// phone: a quarter of the bytes off the memory bus, and integer MACs instead of float ones.
// Ranking only needs the ORDER of the scores, and both scales are positive, so the per-expert
// scale is applied at the end where it costs one multiply per expert instead of one per element.
// Cache-aware substitution: re-rank one layer's routing toward the experts already resident.
//
// The scores come from the tensor the graph itself sorted — the source of the argsort / top_k
// that produced these ids (ffn_moe_probs, or its biased / group-masked variant where the
// architecture has one). Two things make it the right one. It is EXACT: whatever gating function,
// selection bias or group mask the model applies is already in it, so the re-ranking starts from
// the router's real order rather than an approximation of it. And it is ALIVE: the graph reads it
// again after the top-k (ggml_get_rows gathers the weights from it), so the allocator cannot have
// recycled its buffer by the time this callback runs. The gate INPUT does not have that property —
// on Gemma 4 it is a private intermediate of the logits matmul, freed the moment that matmul is
// done, and re-scoring from it read another node's bytes (measured: two layers' inputs at the
// same address).
//
// When that tensor is a softmax, the scores are taken in log space: log-softmax differs from the
// logits by a per-token constant, so its range IS the logit range and the margin means what it
// does in the paper below. Anything else (sigmoid probabilities, raw logits, biased probabilities)
// is ranked on the values as they are.
//
// Each resident expert then gets its score raised by lambda × (max − min) of that token's scores,
// and the top-k is taken again. The margin is a fraction of the token's own range, so the same
// lambda means the same thing on a model whose router scores span 2 and one whose scores span 20 —
// that is what keeps it free of per-model tuning and of calibration state. An expert only wins a
// slot if it is resident AND within the margin of the one it displaces, so a confident routing is
// left alone and a near-tie is resolved in favour of the one already in RAM.
//
// The weights are NOT touched. The graph gathers them from the router's own scores for whatever
// ids end up here, so a substituted expert is applied with the weight the router would have given
// it — the routing changes, the arithmetic that follows does not.
//
// The mechanism is the one Skliar et al. describe for DRAM-cached experts (arXiv:2412.00099);
// here the cache is RAM in front of flash, and the range is the token's own rather than a running
// average, so nothing has to warm up.
