// Flash-backed expert streaming with an optional LRU cache.
//
// Ported from the original research streamer. One layer computes at a time, so with the
// cache off the expert tensors share up to three heap slots (full n_expert size) that
// every layer's tensors are rebound onto: only the routed slices are ever filled,
// re-read fresh each token. With the cache on, each (layer, projection) gets its own
// reserved-but-uncommitted address range; a routed expert already resident is a hit (no
// read), a miss is read once and kept, and the coldest entries are evicted (pages
// physically released) to hold the budget. Reads are drained across an I/O lane pool.
//
// Correctness rests on the eval-callback single-node barrier: the routing node is
// computed and synchronized before load_layer() runs, and the layer's expert matmul
// runs only after it returns — so the routed slices are valid exactly when read, and the
// next layer cannot overwrite them until this layer's matmul has been synchronized.
