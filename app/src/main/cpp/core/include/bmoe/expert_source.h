// The expert-residency port.
//
// An IExpertSource owns where a MoE layer's expert weights live in memory and makes the
// routed experts of a given layer resident just before that layer's expert matmul runs.
// The engine's router hook calls load_layer() with the expert ids the graph selected;
// the implementation blocks until those experts are in place.
//
// This is the seam that keeps the streaming strategy swappable: the default adapter
// (ExpertStreamSource) reads slices from flash on demand with an optional LRU cache, but
// a different residency policy (all-resident, network-fetched, ...) is just another
// implementation of this interface.
