// MoE architecture recipes.
//
// A recipe is the ONLY architecture-specific knowledge in the engine: the gguf tensor
// name suffixes of a layer's expert weight tensors. Everything else — routing, the
// number of experts, the per-expert byte stride — is discovered at runtime from the
// tensors themselves. Supporting a new MoE family is therefore one table row plus a
// byte-identity gate run, never a code change in the streaming path.
//
// This header is pure policy: it has no llama.cpp dependency and compiles standalone.

// The expert weight tensors of a MoE layer, named `blk.<il>.<suffix>.weight` in the gguf.
// A recipe lists the per-layer expert tensors as a suffix table: the common split layout
// names three ({gate, up, down} projections), while architectures that fuse gate+up into
// one tensor name two ({gate_up, down}), and gate-less ones name two ({up, down}). Unused
// slots are nullptr. Each named tensor is 3-D and its dim-2 indexes the expert
// (ne[2] == n_expert); the engine streams whatever the recipe names and never needs to know
// which projection a given tensor carries — a fused gate_up is just an expert tensor with a
// larger per-expert stride, discovered at runtime like any other.
